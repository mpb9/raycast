# RayCast Scripts

## Script: To-Do List

Opens "To-Do List ðŸ«¡" from Notes app & focuses on Notes app

Issues:

- Doesn't complete when ran immediately after closing Notes - set timeout?
- Focus doesnt shift from Raycast->Notes when focused on Notes prior to running script

## Notes

- Convert to try/except block
- Make sure to log errors, find where logs are stored
